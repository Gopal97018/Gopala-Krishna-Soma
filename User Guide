I’m a SaaS Technical Writer with a passion for creating clean, structured, and technically accurate documentation. My expertise includes writing API documentation, integration guides, and end-to-end user guides for cloud-based platforms.

I collaborate closely with developers, product managers, and SMEs to understand product architecture and convert technical details into clear, concise, and actionable content. I also work with tools like Markdown, GitHub, Postman, Swagger/OpenAPI, and Confluence to create documentation that scales.
